# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: My implementation wasn't different from the given one, but we can learn that there's different ways to approach it

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:It is similar to creating a map where you randomly generate things like a maze 

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:I would try making the map made method to make sure I know what objects to use for the hexagons

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: They are similar to a pathway as a room is like a node.
